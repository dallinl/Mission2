<h2> What I hope to get out of 413: </h2>
<p>
    I hope to learn the basics of web app development. I am interested in learning how to translate my knowledge of coding from one language into another.
    I want to get really good ASP.Net as well and see if it is a language or career path that I would be interested in. I am not completely sold on
    coding or development as a career path, so I hope that this class may be of more interest to me as I put in the necessecary time to learn and understand the
    materials.
